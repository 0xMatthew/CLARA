## Installation Guide

- **Windows**: 
    - This repo is compatible with Windows 10+. Specifically, you'll need to use PowerShell 5.1+, which W10 ships with. 
    - Execute `./windows/windows_installer.ps1` with Administrator privileges. This script automates the setup process, including the installation of dependencies and environment configuration. Follow along with program, as there will be some points where manual interaction from the user is expected in order for the installation to continue.
